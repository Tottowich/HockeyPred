Team specific features:
* Powerplay precentage up to that point in the season (PP%)
* Boxplay precentage up to that point in the season (BP%)
* Avg. goals   might not be normalizable. That would be the (ranking of goals scored)/(number of teams). (AG)

* Blocks per game (BPG)
* Faceoff win percentage (FOW%)
* Ratio of goals scored to goals against (GvsGA)
* Ratio of goals scored in even strength to goals scored in powerplay (GvsPPG)
* Ratio of goals conceded in even strength to goals conceded in boxplay. (GAvsBPA)
* Ranking of penalty minutes taken. (PIM)
